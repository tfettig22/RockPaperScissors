# The African Safari Showdown - A spin-off game of rock paper scissors
Written by Tom Fettig

This is my final solo project for 2205 FEE Mod1. I created a customized game of Rock Paper Scissors using HTML, CSS, and three separate JS files. For my game, I chose to re-create the classic style of Rock Paper Scissors and instead the user will be able to choose from exotic animals that will duke it out on the plains of Africa!

In order to open the webpage, just use the deployed URL link listed below.  You may also fork and/or clone this repository and then `cd` into the directory, and run `open index.html`.

 The game will include a Classic version which will have three options to choose from, and a Twist version that includes five different choices. Before the game starts, the user will be able to enter a custom name for both themself and the computer opponent (default values are "Player" and "Opponent").  There is also an option to choose from a list of Tokens, however these tokens have no effect on the game, they are only for fun.  After the player has entered a name, they can choose either "Classic" or "Twist" and the game will begin! The game will store the number of draws, wins for each player, and the total number of rounds played. However, if the user decides to switch the game type the scores will reset and a new game will begin when another game type is chosen. Good luck and Enjoy!
